# Mastermind - Celebrity Recognition App: Front-End

This is the Front-End part of the celebrity recognition app project, developed as a Single Page Application, using _React.js_, structured using Feature-Sliced Design architectural methodology, written with clean, organized and up to date code; utilizing best practices for optimal understanding and readability, as well as the latest tools available.

## Simple sumary

The main purpose of this part of the project is to allow a performant, visually pleasant experience to the user, fast loading and rapid notice of interactive elements (in both mobile and desktop devices), a basic focus in accessibility; as well as the management of any state needed for the user interaction using React.js, and React Router to handle routing across the different pages in the application.

The whole app, in very simple terms, allows the user to register, login, upload an image to detect a celebrity face within it, using an AI model trained by [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/); and increment it's entries while doing the last.
